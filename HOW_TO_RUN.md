# How to run

This project has 2 components, a backend component and a frontend component.

**NOTE:** the backend component requires a mainnet blockfrost key to work, please check the paragraph below for details.

To run the backend, you have to run:

`./gradlew bootRun`

To run the frontend, run instead:

```bash
cd vue-app
npm install
npm run serve -- --port 3000
```

You can now open `http://localhost:3000` with your favourite browser and have some fun
